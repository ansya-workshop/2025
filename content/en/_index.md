## üîç The Workshop Scope

**Neuro-Symbolic** (NeSy) AI is an interdisciplinary field that integrates neural networks‚Äô adaptability and **learning** capabilities with symbolic AI‚Äôs **reasoning**, structure, and interpretability. The NeSy hybrid approaches hold tremendous potential for addressing complex real-world problems, offering a pathway toward more **robust**, **explainable**, and **versatile** AI systems. However, despite significant progress in foundational research, the impact of NeSy approaches outside of academic contexts remains limited. The broader NeSy community continues to struggle with bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and industry adoption. **The NeSy research field has not yet reached a stage where practical applications are common**. The theoretical foundations have been established, but further development and refinement are necessary to translate these concepts into real-world solutions. However, the field has now significantly matured, and it is now ready to begin building practical applications.

The ANSyA workshop aims to fill the NeSy applications void, providing a platform for **applied neuro-symbolic systems engineering**, fostering collaborations between **academia** and **industry**, and encouraging innovative thinking. The workshop aspires to revitalize the applied dimension of neuro-symbolic AI, making it a mainstream paradigm for solving data-driven problems across diverse domains. As such the workshop aims to advance the **practical** dimensions of neuro-symbolic AI, seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and industry adoption, showcasing research that addresses real-world problems and delivers actionable solutions.
