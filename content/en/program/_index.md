The workshop consists of a single half day of activities, including one keynote speech, and poster sessions. The workshop will be held on __Sunday October 26th__ (2nd workshop day) in the afternoon __starting at 14:00__. The allocated room is __"Aula 6.2"__ at the [Engineering School of University of Bologna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o7nfmhguuheY5s9QA) (notice that this is different from the main conference location). __Authors should note that all accepted papers will be presented as posters__.

        <td><i><u>Abstract:</u></i> Neuro-symbolic AI combines the data-driven strengths of machine
learning with the logical reasoning and transparency of symbolic systems,
offering a transformative approach for industrial applications. While
significant progress has been made in academic research, industrial adoption
remains in its early stages. In this talk, I will present our journey at
Bosch in trying to bridge the gap between research and real-world use cases,
focusing on the combination of Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Knowledge
Graphs with machine learning methods, e.g., large language models. I will
present our attempts to apply these hybrid AI approaches in diverse domains
such as conceptual system configuration, production optimization, and market
analysis, while also highlighting key open research questions.  Part of the
work presented in this talk is the result of a collaboration between Bosch
and the Vienna University of Technology.</td>

> __Note for papers' authors:__ We request authors to adhere to the poster session schedule. Authors of the second poster session should read the posters and ask questions to the auhtors of the first poster session and vice-versa. We kindly ask all the authors to attach their posters during the opening session of the workshop. Late authors can attach their posters during the keynote Q&A. The boards used to attach posters will be made available by the workshop organizers.
