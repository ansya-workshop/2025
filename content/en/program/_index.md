> The workshop will consist of a single half day of activities, including one keynote speech, and poster session. 
> __All accepted papers will be presented as posters__.

<!-- While keynote speeches will be delivered by prominent figures in the NeSy community (preferably one from academia and one from industry), 
the poster sessions will be organized to allow authors to present their work to the audience. In particular, each poster shall correspond to one paper accepted for presentation by the program committee. Keynotes will address relevant open issues as well as key challenges affecting the development or deployment of NeSy in real-world scenarios. Moreover, we aim for keynote speakers to provide insights on the recent trends in NeSy engineering and future research directions. On the other hand, the preference for poster sessions over traditional paper presentations is motivated by the desire to foster discussion and interaction among participants. -->

__Time__ and __date__ should be confirmed soon.
Look on the [main conference page](https://ecai2025.org/workshops/) for updates (workshop ID: `W36`).
So far, we know that:
- the allocated date is October 26th (Sunday, 2nd workshop day)
- the allocated time is afternoon
- the allocated room is "Aula 5.5"

__Location__ will be the [Engineering School of University of Bologna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o7nfmhguuheY5s9QA).

## Keynote Speaker

__Title__: Towards Unlocking Industrial Potential with Neuro-Symbolic AI at Bosch: Opportunities and Challenges

__Speaker__: [Dr. Daria Stepanova](https://dariastepanova.github.io/), Bosch Center for AI, Germany

### Abstract

Neuro-symbolic AI combines the data-driven strengths of machine
learning with the logical reasoning and transparency of symbolic systems,
offering a transformative approach for industrial applications. While
significant progress has been made in academic research, industrial adoption
remains in its early stages. In this talk, I will present our journey at
Bosch in trying to bridge the gap between research and real-world use cases,
focusing on the combination of Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Knowledge
Graphs with machine learning methods, e.g., large language models. I will
present our attempts to apply these hybrid AI approaches in diverse domains
such as conceptual system configuration, production optimization, and market
analysis, while also highlighting key open research questions.  Part of the
work presented in this talk is the result of a collaboration between Bosch
and the Vienna University of Technology.
